class FrameObject(_stbt.core.FrameObject):
    # pylint: disable=line-too-long,abstract-method
    r'''
    The Frame Object pattern is used to simplify test-case development and
    maintainance.  Frame Objects are a layer of abstraction between your
    test-cases and the stbt image processing APIs.  They are easy to write and
    cheap to maintain.

    A Frame Object class extracts information from a frame of video, typically
    by calling `stbt.ocr()` or `stbt.match()`. All of your test-cases use these
    objects rather than using `ocr()` or `match()` directly . A Frame Object
    translates from the vocabulary of low-level image processing functions and
    regions (like `stbt.ocr(region=stbt.Region(213, 23, 200, 36)))` to the
    vocabulary of high-level features and user-facing concepts (like
    `programme_title`).

    This base class is provided to make creating well-behaved Frame Objects
    easier.  It defines:

    * `__init__` - optionally taking a frame in the constructor
    * `__nonzero__` - based on the property is_visible which derived classes
      must define.  This means the class will only be considered `True` if
      it's visible, and so the other properties are valid.  This makes it easy
      to use with `wait_until`.
    * `__repr__` - including all the user-defined properties.  This makes using
      the object in doctests convenient
    * `__hash__` and `__cmp__` - If all the properties match between two
      instances of a `FrameObject` then they are considered equal, even if the
      underlying frame is different.  This can be useful for detecting changes
      or waiting for a frame to stop changing before interrogating it.

    **Example Usage**

    This demonstrates basic `FrameObject` usage.  The class below corresponds to
    the dialog box we see in this image that we've captured from our set-top
    box:

    .. figure:: _images/frame-object-with-dialog.png
       :alt: screenshot of dialog box
       :figwidth: 80%
       :align: center

    Here's our Frame Object class:

    >>> class Dialog(FrameObject):
    ...     @property
    ...     def is_visible(self):
    ...         return bool(self._info)
    ...
    ...     @property
    ...     def title(self):
    ...         return ocr(region=Region(396, 249, 500, 50), frame=self._frame)
    ...
    ...     @property
    ...     def message(self):
    ...         right_of_info = Region(
    ...             x=self._info.region.right, y=self._info.region.y,
    ...             width=390, height=self._info.region.height)
    ...         return (ocr(region=right_of_info, frame=self._frame)
    ...                 .replace('\n', ' '))
    ...
    ...     @property
    ...     def _info(self):
    ...         return match('../tests/info.png', frame=self._frame)

    Lets take this line-by-line::

        class Dialog(FrameObject):

    We create a `class` deriving from the `FrameObject` base class.::

        @property
        def is_visible(self):
            return bool(self._info)

    All FrameObjects must define the `is_visible` property.  It will determine
    the truthiness of the object.  Returning `True` from this property indicates
    that this `FrameObject` class can be used with the provided frame and that
    the values of the other properties are likely to be valid.

    In this example we only return True if we see the info icon that appears on
    each dialog box.  The actual work is delegated to the private property
    `_info` defined below.

    It's a good idea to return simple types from these properties rather than
    `MatchResult` s to make the `__repr__` cleaner and to preserve equality
    properties.::

        @property
        def title(self):
            return ocr(region=Region(396, 249, 500, 50), frame=self._frame)

    The base class provides a `self._frame` member.  Here we're using `stbt.ocr`
    to interrogate this frame extracting the dialog title text.  This is the
    basic form that many FrameObject properties will take.

    This property demonstrates an advantage of Frame Objects over just including
    the code in the test directly.  Test code can now write::

        assert Dialog().title == "Information"

    rather than::

        assert (stbt.ocr(region=stbt.Region(396, 249, 500, 50)) ==
                "Information"

    This is a lot more intention revealing, and if the position of the title
    moves there is just one place in your test-pack that needs to be updated.

    When defining Frame Objects you must take care to pass `self._frame` into
    every call to an image processing function.  Otherwise the return values
    won't correspond to the frame you were expecting and you won't be able to
    test the class in isolation.::

        @property
        def message(self):
            right_of_info = Region(
                x=self._info.region.right, y=self._info.region.y,
                width=390, height=self._info.region.height)
            return (ocr(region=right_of_info, frame=self._frame)
                    .replace('\n', ' '))

    This property demonstrates an advantage of Frame Objects over helper
    functions.  We are using the position of the info icon to find this message.
    Because the private `_info` property is shared between this property and
    `is_visible` we don't need to compute it twice - the `FrameObject` base
    class will remember the value from the first time it was computed.::

        @property
        def _info(self):
            return match('../tests/info.png', frame=self._frame)

    This is a private property because its name starts with `_`.  It will not
    appear in `__repr__` nor count toward equality comparisons, but the result
    from it will still be memoized.  This is useful to share intermediate values
    between your public properties, particularly if they are expensive to
    calculate.  In this instance we will be sharing the result between
    `is_visible` and `message`.

    You wouldn't want this to be a public property because it returns a
    `MatchResult` which incorporates the whole of the frame passed into `match`.

    **Using our new Frame Object class**

    In the examples below we always pass a frame into the constructor.  In
    practice you're unlikely to do so: the base class will just grab one from
    stbt.  This allows constructions like::

        dialog = wait_until(Dialog)
        assert 'great' in dialog.message

    But we can also explicitly pass in a frame.  The examples below will make
    use of these example frames:

    >>> from tests.test_frame_object import _load_frame
    >>> dialog = Dialog(frame=_load_frame('with-dialog'))
    >>> dialog_fab = Dialog(frame=_load_frame('with-dialog2'))
    >>> no_dialog = Dialog(frame=_load_frame('without-dialog'))
    >>> dialog_bunnies = Dialog(_load_frame('with-dialog-different-background'))
    >>> no_dialog_bunnies = Dialog(_load_frame(
    ...     'without-dialog-different-background'))

    .. |dialog| image:: _images/frame-object-with-dialog.png

    Some basic operations:

    >>> print dialog.message
    This set-top box is great
    >>> print dialog_fab.message
    This set-top box is fabulous

    `FrameObject` defines truthiness of your objects based on the mandatory
    `is_visible` property:

    >>> bool(dialog)
    True
    >>> bool(no_dialog)
    False

    And if `is_visible` is `False` all the rest of the properties will be
    `None`.

    >>> print no_dialog.message
    None

    This enables usage like::

        assert wait_until(lambda: Dialog().title == 'Information')

    FrameObject defines `__repr__` so you don't have to:

    >>> dialog
    Dialog(is_visible=True, message=u'This set-top box is great', title=u'Information')
    >>> dialog_fab
    Dialog(is_visible=True, message=u'This set-top box is fabulous', title=u'Information')
    >>> no_dialog
    Dialog(is_visible=False)

    Making doctests far more convenient to write (or generate).

    Frame Objects with identical property values are equal, even if the backing
    images are not:

    >>> assert dialog == dialog
    >>> assert dialog == Dialog(_load_frame('with-dialog'))
    >>> assert dialog == dialog_bunnies
    >>> assert dialog != dialog_fab
    >>> assert dialog != no_dialog

    And all `False` ish frame objects of the same type are equal:

    >>> assert no_dialog == no_dialog
    >>> assert no_dialog == no_dialog_bunnies

    FrameObject defines `__hash__` too so you can store them in a `set`:

    >>> {dialog}
    set([Dialog(is_visible=True, message=u'This set-top box is great', title=u'Information')])
    >>> len({no_dialog, dialog, dialog, dialog_bunnies})
    2

    And it defines ordering for you:

    >>> dialog < dialog_bunnies
    False
    >>> dialog_bunnies < dialog
    False
    >>> dialog_fab < dialog
    True

    As Frame Objects only extract information from a given frame and the frame
    cannot change Frame Objects are immutable.  This means that every time a
    property is consulted it will give the same result.  The `FrameObject` base
    class takes advantage of this and will remember the values of each of the
    properties so they only have to be calculated once.  This allows writing
    test cases in a natural way while expensive operations like ``ocr`` will
    only have to be done once per frame.

    **Frame Object Checklist**

    1. Derive from ``FrameObject``.
    2. Define an `is_visible` property returning either ``True`` or ``False``.
    3. Define Python properties extracting information from ``self._frame``
    4. Take care to pass `self._frame` into any image processing function you
       call
